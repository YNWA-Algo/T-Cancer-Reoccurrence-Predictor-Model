# T-Cancer-Reoccurrence-Predictor-Model
This project leverages data from 382 thyroid cancer patients over 15 years to develop a model to predict propensity for reoccurrence based on 16 base features.  This work extends and further explores model improvements off the work done and published by Unviversity of California Irvine (see citation below).  This project using the same base data, an acnhor model (KNN) to serve and baseline comparison with the UCI work but then explores different other model types with the aim of identifying an even (better) predictor model - and save more lives
